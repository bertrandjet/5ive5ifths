					<h2>Anthony Grant</h2>
					<p><q>I love black women, and why shouldn’t I? My mom is Black, all the women in my family are Black, I’m Black. Who else would I love but Black women?</q> <br/><br/>Anthony Grant is an Atlanta poet, who seeks to enforce a concept which seems to be more common sense than revolutionary: that Black Women are human, valuable, and worthy of praise. This sentiment can be seen in his poems.</p>

					<h2>M3</h2>
					<p><q>Self love doesn't always look fabulous. Sometimes it's days crying on the floor, but then the sun rises and we continue. Self love is allowing others to love us when we can't.</q><br/><br/> M3 is a poet who seeks to share her experiences, and express her thoughts and feelings, she hopes that through doing this, others who have similar emotions and inclinations can relate, and grow.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<img src="images/selome-icon.png" class="icon3">
					<h2>Selome</h2>
					<p><q>I experienced a lot of death in my community & hearing the news about black kids getting shot just made me paranoid about all my friends</q><br/><br/> Selome is young, but she has experienced more than some adults. She writes to express herself, as well as to track how she has been feeling over time. She says that she is able to better understand how she was feeling just by reading her poetry.</p>

					<h2>Steffany Herndon</h2>
					<p><q>Even though I discuss my curves personally, it’s really about any part of our bodies that black women struggle accepting, be it curves, stretch marks, or a pudgy stomach.</q><br/><br/>Steffany Herndon is a young poet who attends Emory University. She writes for the people who can relate to having relevant and valid opinions, but may be too shy or introverted to always express them. Those thoughts and opinions are still important, they still matter, even if they are not heard by as many. She values the spaces and the culture that Black people have created for themselves, and seeks to contribute to the Black body of work, using her personal experience, as well as her reactions to current events.</p>

					<h3 id="scrollhere">The Black Woman by Anthony Grant</h3>
					<p>She looks like God to me. <br/>Her dark vibrant eyes seem more vast than the Universe itself, <br/>but somehow rather than lose myself, I have found myself within them.<br/> My reflection in her eyes outmatch any mirror that I have ever gazed upon, she sees me as a King, she sees me as a man she can love. <br/>Her lips are much like Gaea, a plethora of life comes from them. <br/>Every word a new creation, every kiss a renewed existence.<br/> She is my Nirvana.<br/> Her touch is the long awaited Equinox morning after the coldest of winters. <br/>Her warmth is forged from the very depths of Sol, even the Goddess Anchiale can not compare to her. <br/>Her body is the greatest of architectures, an unscathed holy temple, a kingdom far too worthy for any monarch, a pyramid that goes well beyond Paradiso.<br/> She is all things beautiful. <br/>Her laugh is like that of thunder but as gentle as a child.<br/> It envelops you in tranquility & like a contagion, causes you to laugh yourself. <br/>An infectious sound that i long to hear over & over again. <br/>Her mind carries secrets that I wish to discover, for they are the most precious of treasures any man could ever receive. <br/>Her trust is like a diamond. Her greatest quality of all, is her love. <br/>She loves with a passion akin to a mother for her child or an artist to their craft. <br/>Unrelenting, unconditional, & most of all it is pure. <br/>She looks like God to me, & I love her for that. </p>

					<h3 id="scrollhere">One Time For the Girls Like Us by M3</h3>
					<p>here we are<br/>
laying in this bed<br/>
laying in your bed<br/>
your head against my breast<br/>
you hand gently moves my chin<br/>
your lips against my lips<br/>
my femininity affirmed as your hands trace my body and your lips meet my breast<br/>
 <br/>
this is my liberating moment<br/>
this is the moment others told me I didn’t deserve<br/>
they didn’t say it with words<br/>
but in songs, newspaper articles, photoshoots, blog posts, TV shows and textbook stock imagery<br/>
my skin made me too dirty to kiss<br/>
my weight made my kisses a last choice, similarly to the mystery meat in primary school<br/>
my hair made my love a radical political statement when really I’m just a woman with sexual desires<br/>
 <br/>
but in this moment I am just a woman with sexual desires<br/>
there was no paper bag test at the door<br/>
the bed was not a scale<br/>
 <br/>
here we are laying in this bed<br/>
laying in your bed<br/>
indulging in each other’s touch<br/>
a lovers moment<br/>
no requirements necessary</p>
				</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
					<h3 id="scrollhere">Hourglass by Steffany Herndon</h3>
					<p>I can’t remember a moment<br/>
where they haven’t been brought to my attention.<br/>
“I seen your momma, so you obviously got ‘em from her.”<br/>
“What kind of greens you’ve been eating?”<br/>
“Stop being greedy and share girl!”<br/>
If only these were blessings that I asked for…<br/>
 <br/>
A blessing lined with a curse<br/>
Growing up I never felt comfortable with them<br/>
They never fit into any of the jeans designed<br/>
With my skinny friends in mind<br/>
Being the butt of jokes<br/>
because my backside refused to let me fit in<br/>
I could never hide them<br/>
no matter what I tried<br/>
they remained<br/>
And yet know these are the curves that women crave<br/>
The hips they pay for<br/>
The sway they die for<br/>
Same hips I was taught to hate<br/>
Lead my stride as I walk away<br/>
laughing at the irony of life</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3">
				<h3 id="scrollhere">You by Selome</h3>
					<p>​I visited you the other day,<br/>
placed flowers by your name. <br/>
A dozen white roses, <br/>
because I know you have clichés.<br/>
I visited you the other day <br/>
Placed flowers by your grave <br/>
I filled you in on recent events <br/>
To keep you up to date <br/>
I tried to say a prayer,<br/>
But I didn’t have the strength <br/>
To talk to the man up above <br/>
When I lost all my faith<br/>
I visited you the other day, <br/>
Placed flowers by your name <br/>
Reminiscent on the good times;<br/>
so proud of what you overcame. <br/>
Because even though you lost <br/>
The mental war inside your head <br/>
I’m so proud to say that<br/>
You were once my best friend. </p>
